Library Management System
===============

####Software description

This software is used to track items of a library. It provides mechanisms to manage documents, authors, editors, categories, borrowers and handle different acces levels. Borrowers can also use the application but only to search documents. The software has been developped in Java with SWING.

####How to make it work ?

The git repository is a copy of my eclipse workspace. If you want to try the software, just launch the .jar. That version provides full access to the application and includes data to easily test the different features.
